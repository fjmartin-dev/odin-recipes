# odin-recipes

This is a really basic project for The Odin Project course.

This is going to be a simple recipe website where you'll be able to find some lists with some interesting (or random, tbh) recipes.

I'll practice creating the basic HTML template, some lists, some headers and, much probably, some paragraphs!
